# Implimented Fashion_MNIST_NeuralNetwork using Simple Neuron netwrok to clear the basics of Neuron network.
Few new concepts like call back function , improving the model has been implimented on the Fashion Mnist dataset which contains 60k training and 10k testing dataset.
Fashion MNIST dataset is avaliable under Keras library itself.
mnist=tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(training_images,training_labels),(test_images,test_labels)=mnist.load_data()
